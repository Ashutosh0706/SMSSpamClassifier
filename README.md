# SMSSpamClassifier
This is a SMS Spam Classifer machine learning model. It will predict Spam or Not Spam messages based on the imput provided to it. 
I have provided end to end code for this project.
I have used Python for this project, and implemented it on jupyter-notebook.
The code for model model preprocessing, model training and testing, is provided in sms-spam-classifier.ipynb file.
And the code the website creation is in the main.py file. I have used Streamlit to write the app for my project. Streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science.
Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code.
